The data was filtered, parsed, and normalized using image processing techniques using OpenCV and simple dataframe filterations via pandas. YOLOv7 is an upgraded version of the popular YOLO (You Only Look Once) real-time object detection algorithm. Python scripts were created to normalize VIRAT data for YOLO model finetuning as needed. PyTorch was used as the model framework for implementation."
