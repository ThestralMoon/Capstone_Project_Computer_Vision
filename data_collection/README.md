# Data Collection

## VIRAT Video Dataset

The VIRAT (Video and Image Retrieval and Analysis Tool) dataset is a collection of video footage clips that are captured from various sources, including ground surveillance footage as well as footage from UAVs, that have an emphasis on crowded scenes. The dataset comes with annotated ground truth for various ML based computer vision applications such as object detection, tracking, and activity recognition tasks, where the object detection annotations cover a wide variety of of object categories such as people, animals, as well as various objects of interest. 

## COCO Dataset

The COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset is a large-scale image recognition and captioning dataset that contains 330k images with over 200k labeled images. The dataset covers a wide range of object categories, such as people, animals, vehicles, and household items, captured in various real-world contexts. The dataset is commonly used for training and evaluating object detection models, which are used to locate and classify objects within an image. Object detection models trained on the COCO dataset have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of computer vision tasks, such as image segmentation, object tracking, and visual question answering. These models have numerous applications in fields such as autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare.

## Pascal VOC Dataset

The Pascal VOC dataset is another popular dataset for object detection. It consists of images from various real-world scenarios, labeled with bounding boxes and object category labels. The dataset includes 20 object classes, such as cars, people, and animals. Pascal VOC has been widely used as a benchmark for evaluating object detection algorithms. A widely used benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision, specifically for object detection tasks, although its usage has decreased in recent years with the introduction of larger and more diverse datasets such as COCO (Common Objects in Context) and Open Images.
